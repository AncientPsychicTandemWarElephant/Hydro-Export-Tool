# Export Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved ✅

### Problem 1: Single Export Missing Header Fields
**Issue**: When exporting a single file, the Personnel name change worked (showed "Simon Barr") but most technical header fields were empty (Start Time, Author, Device, S/N, Sample Rate, etc.)

**Root Cause**: The `export_processor.py` had a minimal `_parse_header_metadata()` function that only extracted 4 fields using colon (`:`) separation, while Ocean Sonics files use TAB separation.

**Original Limited Parsing**:
```python
# Only parsed: client, job, start_date, timezone
if ':' in line:
    # Very limited field extraction
```

**Fix Applied**: Replaced with comprehensive Ocean Sonics parsing that handles:
- ✅ TAB-separated values (primary Ocean Sonics format)
- ✅ Colon-separated values (fallback for other formats)
- ✅ All 24+ metadata fields including technical parameters

### Problem 2: Multi Export Not Applying Name Changes
**Issue**: When doing multi-file export, all header fields were preserved correctly but user edits (Personnel: "Simon Barr") were not applied - still showed "Nick Trevean".

**Root Cause**: The header override mechanism was working, but the comprehensive parsing and override application needed to be consistent between single and multi-file exports.

**Fix Applied**: Enhanced the metadata parsing to ensure header overrides are properly applied in all export modes.

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Metadata Parsing (`export_processor.py`)

**Before**:
```python
def _parse_header_metadata(self, header_lines):
    # Only 4 fields with colon separation
    if ':' in line:
        # client, job, start_date, timezone only
```

**After**:
```python
def _parse_header_metadata(self, header_lines):
    # Comprehensive parsing with TAB + colon support
    # Maps 24+ fields including all technical parameters
    
def _map_metadata_field(self, key, value, metadata):
    # Complete field mapping for Ocean Sonics format
```

### 2. Complete Field Support

Now correctly parses and preserves:

**File Details**:
- File Type, File Version, Start Date, Start Time
- Timezone, Author, Computer, User
- Client, Job, Personnel, Starting Sample

**Device Details**:
- Device, Serial Number (S/N), Firmware

**Technical Settings**:
- Sample Rate, dB References, FFT Size
- Bin Width, Window Function, Overlap
- Power Calculation, Accumulations

## Test Results ✅

### Metadata Parsing Test
```
File Type: Spectrum ✅
Client: PRO-262 SABIC ✅  
Job: Demonstration ✅
Personnel: Nick Trevean ✅
Device: icListen HF ✅
Serial Number: 7014 ✅
Sample Rate: 64000 ✅
Author: Ocean Sonics' Lucy V4.4.0 ✅
Start Time: 02:12:34 ✅

Parsed 9/9 key fields ✅
```

### Header Override Test
```
Original Personnel: Nick Trevean
Override Personnel: Simon Barr ✅
Override Timezone: Australia/Perth ✅

Personnel override applied: True ✅
Timezone override applied: True ✅
```

### Real Export Test
```
✅ Personnel changed to Simon Barr: True
❌ Old name (Nick Trevean) present: False  
✅ Device info preserved: True
✅ Sample rate preserved: True  
✅ Author info preserved: True
```

## Impact

### Single Export (Previously Broken)
- ✅ **Name changes work** (Personnel: "Simon Barr")
- ✅ **All technical data preserved** (Device, Sample Rate, Author, etc.)
- ✅ **Complete Ocean Sonics header format maintained**

### Multi Export (Previously Missing Name Changes)  
- ✅ **Name changes now applied** (Personnel: "Simon Barr")
- ✅ **All technical data still preserved** 
- ✅ **Consistent behavior with single export**

## Files Modified

1. **`export_processor.py`**:
   - Enhanced `_parse_header_metadata()` with comprehensive Ocean Sonics parsing
   - Added `_map_metadata_field()` for complete field mapping
   - Now handles TAB-separated values correctly

2. **Test files created**:
   - `test_export_fix.py` - Unit tests for parsing and overrides
   - `test_real_export.py` - Integration test with actual Ocean Sonics files

## User Experience

**Before**:
- Single export: Name change ✅, technical data ❌  
- Multi export: Name change ❌, technical data ✅

**After**:
- Single export: Name change ✅, technical data ✅
- Multi export: Name change ✅, technical data ✅

**Result**: Both export modes now work correctly with complete metadata preservation and proper application of user edits.

*Export fixes completed and verified - both single and multi-file exports now handle Ocean Sonics format correctly with full metadata preservation and header override support.*
